                Hi, I'm Kaily (kay-lee). I'm seventeen and a high school senior from New Jersey (very exciting!). 
            Although I'm still not sure about what I'm doing (with this website or in my life), this page seems pretty immaculate. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Some fun facts about me: 
                I love bubble tea and phá»Ÿ, but food is generally very good;
                I'm Chinese-Canadian-America (dual citizens are pretty cool); 
                and I have an unhealthy obsession with propagating succulents (aka ripping off succulent leaves and letting the grow new plants).  
            </p>
